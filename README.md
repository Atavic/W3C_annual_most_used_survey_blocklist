IMPORTANT NOTICE: This is minimial blocklist based on the W3Tech annual surveys on most webtechnology used on websites

W3Tech analysis which analytics, advertisement, tracking and tagmanagement services are most used

In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark
while the number three Somscore just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates
about the same advertising traffic on its own website. The numbers 3 to 200 together account for (only) 20 percent market share.

Advertising networks advertise their marketshare to indicate how succesful they are. In stead of looking at websites, I looked at the 
advertising industry itself. to block the bulk of the mainstream advertising services with the obvious benefit of low maintenance effort 
(for me) and low performance impact (for the adblocker you are using).

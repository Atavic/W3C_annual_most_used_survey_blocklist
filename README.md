                                                         SOURCES
The blocklist based on surveys on most used webtechnology related to advertising and tracking. These surveys are only updated once a year.
This is the reason of the low update frequency (once a year a new version, ad hoc corrections to prevent website breakage). 

                                                          USAGE 
Important to know that both the Top500 and Top3000 mostly contain advertisement and tracking networks used in West Europe and North America.
Therefore it is adviced to add you language specific Easylist filter when using these filters. All domains of Top500 are also blocked by the
Top3000 list. The Top500 actually has a little more than 500 domains listed, the Top3000 a little less.

                                               WHY USE A SMALL BLOCK BLOCK LIST?                                        
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark while the
number three Comscore just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates about the same
advertising traffic on its own website. Number 100 on this list is probably used at 5000 websites of the Alexa Top 300.000 websites, while
number 250 may only track you on 500 websites of the Alexa Top 300.000 (websited with more than 3000 unique visitors per day). 

                                          ALTERNATIVES WITH SIMULAR BLOCKING APPROACH
When you want a common use well maintained small blocklist, you can also use Disconnect's Simple Ad-filter or Peter Low's blocklist. 
These lists also aim to block adnetworks instead of adsvertismens on websites (that is why they only have over 3000 blacklisted URL's).

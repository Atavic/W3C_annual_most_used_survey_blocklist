IMPORTANT NOTICE: This is minimial blocklist based on the W3Tech annual surveys on most webtechnology used on websites

W3Tech analysis which analytics, advertisement, tracking and tagmanagement services are most used

In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark
while the number three Comscore just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates
about the same advertising traffic on its own website. 

Advertising networks advertise their marketshare to indicate how succesful they are. In stead of looking at websites, I looked at the 
advertising industry itself. to block the bulk of the mainstream advertising services with the obvious benefit of low maintenance effort 
(for me) and low performance impact (for the adblocker you are using).

Number 250 on this list only has a marginal market share of 0.1% on the Alexa top 10000. That is why I use an adblock extension with an
easy point and click mechanisme to block or hide annoying stuff on the websites I have added to my bookmarks. No matter how large the 
blocklist, you blocklist will always be missing trackers on websites with low visitors.

Problem withmost community based blocklists is that they are not well maintained. Opera once checked the effectiveness of Easylist and
reported in a blog that 20 percent of the listed URL were dead and another 60% had a 'hit rate' of less than 1% of all the traffic 
measured of Opera users (having enabled Opera's build-in adblocker and agreed wih providing telemetry data).

When you want a common use well maintained small blocklist, use most common adblockers of Disconnet or Peter Low's blocklist (both around
3000 rules). When a well maintained medium sized blocklist, use Steven Black's blocklist. When you want a large blocklist have a look at 
the 'ultimate' blocklist of Energized.pro

When you still want to use this blocklist, feel free to use it and provide feedback on errors. You can post issues, but I will only have 
a look at it when the issue causes a problem on an COM, INF, NET or ORG domain.

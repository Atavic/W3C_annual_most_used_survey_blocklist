The blocklist based on surveys on most used webtechnology related to advertising and tracking. These surveys are only updated once a year.
This is the reason of the low update frequency (once a year a new version, ad hoc corrections to prevent website breakage). 

                                                          USAGE 
Important to know that the blocklist contains advertisement and tracking networks used in West Europe and North America. 
When you decide to use this filter, it is good practice to add you language specific Easylist filter. Language specific filters
often contain website specific block and hiding rules (first party rules), which supplement this (third-party) blocklist well. 
This lists aims to block (third-party) advertising and tracking networks which are used on the (first-party) websites you visit.  

                       WHY USE A SMALL AD&TRACKING NETWORKS BLOCK LIST WITH YOUR COUNTRY SPECIFIC EASYLIST BLOCKLIST?                                        
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark while the
number three Comscore just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates about the same
advertising traffic on its own website. Number 100 on this list is probably used at 5000 websites of the Alexa Top 300.000 websites, while
number 250 may only track you on 500 websites of the Alexa Top 300.000 (websited with more than 3000 unique visitors per day).

This blocklist is based on surveys of most used advertising and tracking technology (e.g. surveys of W3C, W3Tech and the
on-line marketing community itself). These tech surveys are held once a year. This is the reason of the low update frequency 
(365 days and ad hoc corrections to correct website breakage).Those surveys are oriented on Europe and North America, this is
the reason this blocklist contains mostly EU and US based advertising and tracking networks. 

                                WHY USE A SMALL ADVERTISING AND TRACKING NETWORKS BLOCK LIST? 
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark 
while the number three Comscore just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates 
about the same advertising traffic on its own website. Number 100 on this list is probably used at 5000 websites of the Alexa 
Top 300.000 websites, while number 250 may only track you on 500 websites of the Alexa Top 300.000. 

                                                         USAGE 
When you decide to use this filter, it is good practice to add you language specific Easylist filter. Language specific filters
often contain specific block and hide rules of teh websites you visit (first party). This blocklist aims to block advertising 
and tracking networks which are used on the websites you visit (third-party). That is why they supplement each other well.

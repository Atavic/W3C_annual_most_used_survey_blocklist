                                                         NOTICE
This is a minimial blocklist based on the W3Tech annual surveys on most webtechnology used on websites

                                                         USEAGE
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark
while the number three Comscore just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates
about the same advertising traffic on its own website. 

Advertising networks advertise their marketshare to indicate how succesful they are. In stead of crawling the web analyzing Alexa's 
TOP 500.000 websites, I looked at the advertising industry itself, to block the bulk of the mainstream advertising services with the 
obvious benefit of low maintenance effort (for me) and low performance impact (for the adblocker you are using).

                                               WHY USE A MINIMAL BLOCKLIST?
Number 250 on this list only has a marginal market share of 0.1% on the Alexa top 10000. That is why I use an adblock extension with an
easy point and click mechanisme to block or hide annoying stuff on the websites I have added to my bookmarks. No matter how large the 
blocklist will be, your blocklist will always be missing trackers on websites with low visitors.

Problem with most community based blocklists is that they are not well maintained. Opera once checked the effectiveness of Easylist and
reported in a blog that 20 percent of the listed URL were dead and another 60% had a 'hit rate' of less than 1% of all the traffic
of the Opera browser users (having agreed to provide telemetry data). Scientifics studies showed that large blocklist are (a little)
more effective on 'long tail' websites (not in Alexa top 500.000), but a little less effective on Alexa top top 500000 (websitws with
more than 2000+ visitors per day), because common blocklist trigger adblock walls and anti-adblock measures.

                                                      ALTERNATIVES
When you want a common use well maintained small blocklist, use most Disconnet common Ad-filter or Peter Low's blocklist (over 3000
blacklisted URL's). When a well maintained medium sized blocklist, use Steven Black's blocklist (50K+ blacklisted URL's). When you 
want a large blocklist have a look at the 'ultimate' blocklist of Energized.pro (over 700K URL's blacklisted).

                                                    ERRORS & ISSUES
When you still want to use this blocklist, feel free to use it and provide feedback on errors. You can post issues, but I will only have 
a look at it when the issue causes a problem on an COM, INF, NET or ORG domain.
